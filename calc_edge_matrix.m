% Calculate adjacent edges for given node in a triangulated network, save the result in a matrix
% Each row represents all adjacent edges for a node
%
% For a given node N, it is the common vertex for six faces, just like this
%         23  --  9
%        /  \   /  \
%       68 -- N -- 36
%        \  /   \  /
%         80  -- 47
% Six edges connect N and its neighbor vertice
% calc_edge_matrix return a matrix, the Nth row of the matrix is like this 
%     9    23    36    47    68    80     0     0     0     0
% From that row, the neighbor vertice of N is obtained in ascending order with zero filling at tail
