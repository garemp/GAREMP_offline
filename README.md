## Sample file

File 'maps+sample.json' which is generated from [Gephi](https://github.com/gephi/gephi) (A Graph modelling and visualization tool) is provided as the source and sample file of the following offline processes.

![RAW JSON FILE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garemp/GAREMP_offline/master/screensnap/raw.json.jpg)

You can process your own JSON file by using the following approach.

## Prerequisites

Offline processes of GAREMP is dependent on three MATLAB libraries: 

[fangq](https://github.com/fangq)/[JSONLAB](https://github.com/fangq/jsonlab) (a MATLAB toolbox to encode/decode JSON files), 

[AntonSemechko](https://github.com/AntonSemechko)/[Bounding-Spheres-And-Circles](https://github.com/AntonSemechko/Bounding-Spheres-And-Circles) (a library to find minimum bounding spheres for given set of points), 

[matlab-toolboxes](https://github.com/gpeyre/matlab-toolboxes), a function (i.e., compute_edges, to compute list of edges, from list of faces) which is included in toolbox_graph is used in GAREMP_offline, toolbox_graph is included in matlab-toolboxes.

Offline processes of GAREMP is also dependent on two executables:

[Flow-Based Cartogram Generator](https://github.com/Flow-Based-Cartograms/go_cart) and [brrcrites](https://github.com/brrcrites)/[graph-coloring](https://github.com/brrcrites/graph-coloring).

Clone above dependence (JSONLAB, Bounding-Spheres-And-Circles, matlab-toolboxes, Flow-Based Cartogram Generator, and graph-coloring), and build Flow-Based Cartogram Generator, and graph-coloring, move executables of Flow-Based Cartogram Generator, and graph-coloring to this folder.

## Offline Processes of GAREMP

### mark directed edges

Run addArrows('maps+sample.json', 'maps+arrows.json'); to mark directed edges as 'curved' in maps.json.

### flip undirected deges

Run flipEdges('maps+arrows.json', 'maps+flipped.json'); to flip source and target end-points of undirected edges if needed.

### distort the graph

Run distortGraph('maps+flipped.json', 'maps+distort.json'); to distort the graph based on cartogram algorithm.

This step would take a long time for cartogram-based distortion. Have a break.

Distorted graph are shown as below.

![Distorted Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garemp/GAREMP_offline/master/screensnap/distorted.json.jpg)

### flip undirected deges once more

Run flipEdges('maps+distort.json', 'maps+mono.json'); to flip source and target end-points of undirected edges once more.

### calc and add colors

Run addColors('maps+mono.json', 'maps+color.json'); to calculate intersection between edges and assign distinct colors to intersected edges.

Chromatic graph are shown as below.

![Chromatic Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garemp/GAREMP_offline/master/screensnap/chromatic.json.jpg)

### add attributes and relationship

Run addInfo('maps+color.json', 'maps.json'); to add attributes, classification, relationship, adjust order or drawing, and calculate neighborship of nodes and endpoints of edges to obtain the final JSON file used in GAREMP.

### Run commands in one command

All above commands could be executed in batch in function garemp_offline().

## Sequences of JSON file

export form Gephi -> maps+sample.json -> maps+arrows.json -> maps+flipped.json -> maps+distort.json -> maps+mono.json -> maps+color.json -> maps.json -> used in [GAREMP!](http://garemp.github.io)
